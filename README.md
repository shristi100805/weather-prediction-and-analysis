Delhi Weather Forecast using Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete machine learning project focused on predicting daily average temperatures for Delhi, India.

The project pipeline includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature engineering from a time-series dataset.

Model Training: Implementing and training a Random Forest Regressor to predict temperature based on historical data.

Prediction Tool: An interactive Python script that allows users to input a date and get a temperature prediction.

Tools: Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and joblib for model persistence.
